For reasons beyond his comprehension[pst] Salvator Quanuchie was spit from the
universe like a watermelon seed[phsss-pthut]  Never to be heard from again[pthut]

[chic-chic]I see[chic-chic][pst] said the blind man[pst] as he picked up his hammer and saw[pthut]

[phsss-pthut]

[pthut][phsss-pthut][pst][fshhh][chic][chic-chic][pssu-pthut]

How about a program[pssu-pthut]  That would be interesting (I can[chic]t put blank lines
in it[pst] though)[pthut]

#include <stdio[pthut]h>
main()
{
   int   i;
   for (i=9; i >= 0; i[fshhh][fshhh])                  /* Gotta get the [fshhh][fshhh] in[phsss-pthut] */
      printf([chic-chic]Hello[pst] world[phsss-pthut] (%d)\n[chic-chic][pst] i);
}

Hey[pst] I was right[phsss-pthut]  That was interesting[phsss-pthut][phsss-pthut][phsss-pthut][phsss-pthut][phsss-pthut]

writeln([chic]Testing the [chic][chic][chic]);

This is the data for the problem named Vocal[pst] perhaps the easiest problem
in the set[pst] in the High School Programming Tournament [fshhh][fshhh] or [chic-chic]High School
Contest[chic-chic] as it is sometimes called for short[pthut]  Will it be solved the most[pssu-pthut]
We thought so in our judges[chic] meetings[phsss-pthut]  However[pst] the problem named Base
could beat it[pthut]  [chic-chic]Only time will tell[chic-chic] as someone once said[pthut]

Unfortunately[pst] this is the end of the judge data[pthut]  This problem does not
have too many special cases except for the [chic-chic]pronounced[chic-chic] [fshhh][fshhh] what else
could we call it[pssu-pthut] [fshhh][fshhh] punctuation[pthut]  However[pst] it[chic]s gonna be fun to just this
one[phsss-pthut]  :[fshhh])
