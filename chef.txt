                              Problem Name: CHEF

     The Swedish Chef of the Muppets has a very difficult time communicating
with Kermit and the other Muppets.  This is due to his strong Swedish accent
on English.  Therefore, Kermit would like to have the other Muppets practice
listening to Swedish-accented English.  They need your help.


THE PROBLEM:

     You are to write a translator that converts English to Swedish-accented
English.  To do this, all you have to do is replace substrings in sentences
with other substrings.  In the table below, the left column shows the original
English substring and the right column shows what it should be converted into
(ignore all quotation marks):

                         FROM:          TO:
                         --------       --------
                         "and"          "und"
                         "And"          "Und"
                         "Then"         "Den"
                         "then"         "den"
                         "the"          "der"
                         "The"          "Der"
                         "Yes"          "Ya"
                         "yes"          "ya"
                         "Which"        "Vich"
                         "which"        "vich"
                         "x."           "xy."
                         "x "           "xy "
                         "w "           "w "
                         "w"            "v"
                         "W"            "V"
                         "d."           "dy."
                         "d "           "dy "
                         "p."           "py."
                         "p "           "py "
                         "v"            "f"
                         "e "           "ey "
                         "e."           "ey."
                         "ir"           "ur"
                         "or"           "ur"
                         "ou"           "oo"
                         "ue"           "oo"
                         "Th"           "D"
                         "th"           "d"
                         "ick"          "ook"

Note that when applying substitutions, you should try the rules above from
top to bottom.  Anything else that does not match one of these rules should
be left alone in the output.  Furthermore, make sure you do not apply a rule
to text that is the output from the application of another rule.


THE INPUT:

     The input file will start with an integer "n" on a line by itself.  On
the following "n" lines there will be English text for you to translate.


THE OUTPUT:

     Each line of the output will be the Swedish-accented English translation
of each line of the input.  Do not worry if the conversion makes the line wrap
past 80 columns.
