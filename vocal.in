For reasons beyond his comprehension, Salvator Quanuchie was spit from the
universe like a watermelon seed!  Never to be heard from again.

"I see", said the blind man, as he picked up his hammer and saw.

How about a program?  That would be interesting (I can't put blank lines
in it, though).

#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
   int   i;
   for (i=9; i >= 0; i--)                  /* Gotta get the -- in! */
      printf("Hello, world! (%d)\n", i);
}

Hey, I was right!  That was interesting!!!!!

This is the data for the problem named Vocal, perhaps the easiest problem
in the set, in the High School Programming Tournament -- or "High School
Contest" as it is sometimes called for short.  Will it be solved the most?
We thought so in our judges' meetings!  However, the problem named Base
could beat it.  "Only time will tell" as someone once said.

Unfortunately, this is the end of the judge data.  This problem does not
have too many special cases except for the "pronounced" -- what else
could we call it? -- punctuation.  However, it's gonna be fun to just this
one!  :-)
